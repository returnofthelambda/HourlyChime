# Hourly Chime Wear OS App

Description: Simple hourly chime app for Android Wear OS devices. This app requires the user provide permission to set alarms and no other permissions. Provides a simple two chime alarm every hour. App is manually toggled on or off with the ability to set a start / stop time. I may improve functionality at some point, but don't expect much.

Built entirely with Gemini 2.5 Pro, so if it bricks your device blame Google, not me (just kidding, please don't sue me Google). Only tested on a Google Pixel Watch 1.
